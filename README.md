### Responsibilities:  

- Architected and led the development of database-driven UX flows with Spring MVC and Thymeleaf, boosting customer conversions, feedback recording, lead capture, and multi-partner data posting.  
- Spearheaded the development of an intuitive web application for Ad Flow, which remarkably reduced the setup time for business owners by 80%. The user-friendly interface was designed using TypeScript of React.js. The robust microservice APIs were engineered using Java 17, Open API (Swagger), and Spring Boot 3.0. To ensure efficient data storage and management, we integrated the solution with MySQL. 
- Enhanced system performance by implementing indexing strategies and leveraging MongoDB's flexible schema for adaptive data storage. Utilized MongoDB's robust querying capabilities and aggregation framework to enable real-time analytics and insights from captured event data 
- Enhanced security, observability, and traffic management by implementing Service Mesh using Istio and Orchestrated microservices deployment using Kubernetes and Kloudfuse. 
- Took ownership of mission-critical modules, including Billing and Ad Flow, driving the strategic direction and ensuring seamless operations. Proactively managed business requests, resolving issues promptly, and migrated Monolithic systems to fault-tolerant, resilient, and auto-scalable microservices architecture. 
- Reduced database load and significantly improved query response times by configuring Ehcache with multi-level caching and clustering and achieved a 35% reduction in backend load and improved user login times by implementing Memcached for session data and API response caching. 
- Implemented asynchronous processing using Task Executor in a Spring Boot 3.0 (Spring Data, Spring Batch) application to upload millions of images to AWS S3, resulting in a 50% performance improvement. 
- Leveraged my experience in building and managing cloud infrastructures to optimize performance, scalability, cost-efficiency using AWS ECS, EBS, MSK, and DynamoDB, as well as Azure VMs, Blob Storage, SQL Database.
